This is an artifical intelligence project design to solve a sliding puzzle.

example: 
# 3, 2, "B"
# 1, 7, 8
# 6, 5, 4

The above represents a puzzle.  The only legal moves are to "slide" pieces into the blank spot, ("B").

Our desired state is
# 1, 2, 3
# 4, 5, 6
# 7, 8, "B"

We will attempt to find a series of moves from our starting state to the goal state through the 
Breadth First Search Algorithm and the A* Algorithm.

These are implemented via queues and the program will print a path to the desired state from each algorithm.
Note that the A* algorithm does not guarantee an accurate path.
