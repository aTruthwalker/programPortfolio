 This is a project where I and two others, (Turki Alhazzani and Turki Albawalwi),
predicted what classes highschool students would be interested in based on class history and educational progress.

I led this project and directed most of our efforts, as well as handled implementing specific features 
such as designing and programming teh context-aware system--a system that takes into account
a student's given interests and generates classes based on those interests.
